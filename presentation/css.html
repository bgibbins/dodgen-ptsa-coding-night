<hr>
<p><b>Cascading Style Sheets</b> (or <b>CSS</b>) were created to meet the growing need to make the pages look better. The term was first registered in March 1998 and changed the design aspect of web development forever.</p>
<p>By separating the structure (HTML) from the presentation (CSS) it allowed developers to specialize in just how a website would look while using a whole new set of "tags" that targeted particular HTML tags. Some old HTML tags were removed while others took their place to allow for better CSS control.</p>
<p>Another CSS advantage allowed presentation to be set by a particular device. Originally, just screen or print, eventually CSS grew to allow the presentation to adapt to specifics like what version of OS is running on a mobile phone or tablet.</p>
