<p><b>HTML</b> (Hyper Text Markup Language) provides the structure in this important group of three technologies and was the first to be introduced. Originally published in a paper by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 in a document called "HTML Tags", then formally in 1993 as as a specification "Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)" Internet-Draft". The initial abilities of HTML were very limited. As developers we only had 18 tags in the <i>MARKUP LANGUAGE</i> used to describe what would be seen in what we have come to know today as browsers.</p>
<p>The simplified purpose of HTML was to create a standard markup language which could be used with all computer systems to display content in the same way and allow each computer (server) to be linked together such that a user could click a link in the text to get to the next related document.</p>
<p>Simply defined a markup language is one that uses very specific text wrapped around other text that makes the text between two points behave in a predefined manner.</p>
<h3>Wha...?</h3>
<p>This is best demonstrated in an example.</p>
<p>Back in the day we were only able to make things <b>bold</b> or <i>italic</i> or to <a href="css.html">link them to the next page</a>. There weren't even any images. :( In fact, this entire page so far has ONLY been HTML.</p>
<p>Check it out!</p>
<div style="background:black;color:white;margin:25px;padding:15px;font-family:Courier;font-size:24px;">
    &lt;h3&gt;Wha...?&lt;/h3&gt;<br>
    &lt;p&gt;This is best demonstrated in an example.&lt;/p&gt;<br>
    &lt;p&gt;Back in the day we were only able to make things &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;i&gt;italic&lt;/i&gt; or to &lt;a href="css.html"&gt;link them to the next page&lt;/a&gt;. There weren't even any images. :( In fact, this entire page so far has ONLY been HTML.&lt;/p&gt;<br>
    &lt;p&gt;Check it out!&lt;/p&gt;
</div>

<p>While HTML started with only a handful of <i>tags</i> it quickly became apparent that more were needed. <a href="html-2.html">HTML grew rapidly...</p>
