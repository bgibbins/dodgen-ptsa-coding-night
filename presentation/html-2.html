<h2>Images</h2>
<p>With the formal specification in 1993 came the ability to add images. The GIF (or Graphics Interchange Format) had been introduced in 1987 by CompuServe. So developers of the HTML standard added a new tag to make them visible in the <i>broswer.</i></p>

<p>But, GIFs only have a maximimum of 256 individual colors, so along came JPEG (or JPG) with a the potential of 16 million different colors.</p>
