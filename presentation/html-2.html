<h2>Introduction to how they work together to power web and mobile apps.</h2>

<h3>Images</h3>
<p>With the formal specification in 1993 came the ability to add images. The GIF (or Graphics Interchange Format) had been introduced in 1987 by CompuServe. So developers of the HTML standard added a new tag to make them visible in the <i>broswer.</i></p>
<p>
    <img src="Rotating_earth_large.gif">
</p>
<p>But, GIFs only have a maximimum of 256 individual colors, so along came JPEG (or JPG) with a the potential of 16 million different colors.</p>

<h3>Bloating</h3>
<p>Then more and more custom tags came along...</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The ability to add <span style="color:red">color</span> to individual sections of text was added using a very flaky "font" tag.</li>
        <li>and blinking text (it was really a thing)</li>
        <li>and more specilized tags were added</li>
        <li>Before too long, the original purpose of HTML, the structure, was getting bloated with custom tags that affected the layout on the screen.</li>
</ul>
