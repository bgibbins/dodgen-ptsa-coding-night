    <p><b>Cascading Style Sheets</b> (or <b>CSS</b>) were created to meet the growing need to make the pages look better. The term was first registered in March 1998 and changed the design aspect of web development forever.</p>
    <p>By separating the structure (HTML) from the presentation (CSS) it allowed developers to specialize in just how a website would look while using a whole new set of "tags" that targeted particular HTML tags. Some old HTML tags were removed while others took their place to allow for better CSS control.</p>
    <p>Another CSS advantage allowed presentation to be set by a particular device. Originally, just screen or print, eventually CSS grew to allow the presentation to adapt to specifics like what version of OS is running on a mobile phone or tablet.</p>
<h2 style="color:black;">That's Better!</h2>
    <p>Now that we have structure from HTML and presentation from CSS we'll add <a href="javascript.html">one last component.</a></p>
