<h2>Introduction to how they work together to power web and mobile apps.</h2>

<h2>Bloating</h2>
<p>More and more and more custom tags came along...</p>
<p>...with tags and presentation differing between the companies entering the browser market.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The ability to add <span style="color:red">color</span> to individual sections of text was added using a very flaky "font" tag.</li>
        <li>and blinking text (yes, it was really a thing)</li>
        <li>and developers wanted to add functionality and the ability to interact with the HTML with "real" programs</li>
        <li>and designers wanted to make the presentation better by adding color and drop-shadows and animation</li>
        <li>and still more specialized tags were added</li>
        <li>and so began the <i>browser wars</i></li>
        <li>Before too long, the original purpose of HTML - the structure, was getting bloated with custom tags that affected the layout on the screen.</li>
</ul>
