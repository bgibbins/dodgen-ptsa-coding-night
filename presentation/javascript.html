   <p>Javascipt provides function to the structure and presentation of the application. The original "language" was written in 10 days by an employee of Netscape (now Mozilla).</p>
    <p>1996-1997 was an exciting time for web developers because Javascript was the first language that actually operated in the browser itself.</p>
    <p>This meant that the application could run faster since it didn't need to contact a remote server over a sometimes slow Internet connection. This was before broadband Internet connections were popular in homes and most people were using a modem to "dial up to the ISP" and "get on the Internet".</p>
    <p>Now we carry our connection to the Internet in our pocket and connect to wi-fi when we can and we can use Javascript to <a onclick="showModem();">change things on the page,</a> even on our mobile devices.</p>
<p>Now let's move on to a simple application.</p>
    <h3>A User Story</h3>
    <p>As a teacher I would like to be able to keep track of each student by where they sit at their desks in each classroom.</p>
    <p>Requirements:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>3 total class rooms</li>
        <li>Class rooms all have hold 12 desks</li>
        <li>Desks are arranged in 3 rows and 4 columns</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Application will use:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>HTML</b> to designate the structure of the data, then</li>
            <li><b>CSS</b> to present the structure and finally,</li>
            <li><b>Javascript</b> to manage the data for students in each classroom</li>
        </ul>
