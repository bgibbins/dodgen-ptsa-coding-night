   <p><b>Javascipt</b> provides function to the structure and presentation of the application. The original "language" was written in 10 days by an employee of Netscape (now Mozilla).</p>
    <p>Things were moving at a very quick pace. 1996-1997 was an exciting time for web developers because Javascript was the first language that actually operated in the browser itself. Many of us eagerly awaited Internet Explorer as one of the early adopters of Javascript in the browser.</p>
    <p>This meant that the application could run faster since it didn't need to contact a remote server over a sometimes slow Internet connection. Remember, this was before broadband Internet connections were popular in homes and most people were using a modem to "dial up to the ISP" and "get on the Internet".</p>
    <p>Now we carry our connection to the Internet in our pocket and we can use Javascript to <a onclick="showModem();">change things on the page,</a> even on our mobile devices.</p>
<h3>Now let's move on to a simple application...</h3>
    <p><b>A User Story</b></p>
    <p><i>"As a teacher I would like to be able to keep track of each student by where they sit at their desks in each classroom."</i></p>
    <p>Requirements:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>3 total class rooms</li>
        <li>Class rooms all have 12 desks</li>
        <li>Desks are arranged in 3 rows and 4 columns</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Application will use:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>HTML</b> to designate the structure of the data, then</li>
            <li><b>CSS</b> to present the structure and finally,</li>
            <li><b>Javascript</b> to manage the data for students in each classroom</li>
        </ul>
